# UIUC ECE411 First 3 Machine Problems
###All MPs
The series of MPs are a walk though of the creation and (some) design of the Little Computer 3b (lc3b) microprocessor, with a level 1, 2-way set associative cache, using a LRU write-back eviction policy.  
All of these MPs were completed using SystemVerilog.  
MP specific notes are found below.  

###MP0
This MP was mostly a walkthrough in order to get things set up.  
We were given some starter code and a drawing of the data path and asked to complete the data path and state machine based on the drawing and documentation.  A few modules needed to be created in order to complete the design.  In the end, we had a functioning processor, with a very limited instruction set.  

###MP1
For MP1, we were asked to continue the work from MP0, and complete the instruction set of the LC3b microprocessor.  This time, there was very little guidance.  In fact, the first check point was just creating a complete drawing of our data path that included all the necessary hardware for successful operation.   

###MP2
This is the final solo MP for the class, where we needed to add a 2-way set associative cache to our processor.  Again, there was no guidance aside from the specifications that our cache needed to adhere to.
